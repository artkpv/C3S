# CCS on compound sentences (C3S)

Repository for the publication about unsupervised method for lie detection. 

Finding internal knowledge representation(s) inside transformer models without supervision is certainly a challenging task which is important for scalable oversight and to mitigate the deception risk factor. We are testing Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS1) on TruthfulQA dataset for compound sentences (conjunction and disjunction) each composed of several answers to a question to see if unsupervised probes work to the same degree as on simple statements that compound ones consist of, with the goal to improve unsupervised methods to discover latent knowledge.
